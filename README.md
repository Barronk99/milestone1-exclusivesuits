## Features 

All pages feature a navbar which is responsive with a fixed logo in the top left and the menu items to the right of the logo on desktop but appears centrally with the menu icon just below the logo on screen sizes less than 991px wide. 

Each page also features a footer which has links to social media pages, website pages and copyright information. 

Every page apart from the home page also has a h3 heading at the top of the page as a main title for the content. The homepage instead has a textblock with a grey backgroud for contrast with white text which reads 'Welcome to Xclusive SUITS' a simple welcome message to comfort the visitor.

#### **Home**

On the homepage appears a full scree image carousel with a welcome message and a small heading with a catchy slogan on each image. This feature is so straight away the visitor can see what the company is about and the quality of suits the company produces, demonstrated by the images in the carousel, and also what they can expect as they scroll through the site and gathr more information. This is important because a good first impression is key to making sure the visitor stays on the site for as long as possible but also so the visitor knows exactly what to expect from the website and the business.

Followed by the carousel is a small sales pitch section with the main company slogan as a header inside two custom styled 'hr' elements to give it more emphasis so it stands out. Underneath this comes a small paragraph that sells the user on who Xclusive Suits are and why they are the best in the business. This section essentially highlights why the customer should use their service.

Finally, after the sales section comes three navigation cards each which feature an image that relates to the topic of the card, a small paragraph giving a brief introduction to where the card will take the vistor and then a button linking to the page related to the navigation card. On desktop view the navigation cards appear in one row each with a column size of 4/12 so this means they can appear next to each other side by side. However, on mobile and tablet size screens they each have a full column each so this means they appear oene after the other underneath each other. I decided to present it this way on mobile/tablet screens because otherwise they would overlap each other and it would look unprofessional so this maintains a clean and professional look.

#### **The Xclusive Experience** 

The Xclusive Experience page features a heading followed by small print text underneeth which is a slogan, for extra design. Underneath the pages heading is a full width video which demonstrates the process of using Xclusive Suits. This video appears as the fist thig on the page because it shows everything and it is convenient with it being a short consice video lasting only 1 minute and 18 seconds. The video is set with controls so it doesn't automatically play just incase visitors are not connected to WiFi and don’t want to use their data.
Just underneath the video comes a small paragraph that runs the length of the screen and gives a brief explanation of what to expect from the Xclusive Suits, this is only a brief paragraph because the video has already covered most if not evryhting the user will need to know about how their service will work.
Next after the paragraph is a full width image banner with the 5 steps of the Xclusive experience and five genetlemen in various suits showing the range and variety the Xclusive Suits has to offer. However, on small screens and up to 518px wide I have split the images into two halves so the five steps banner and the 5 gentlemen in suits cover a full column each so the two images appear one ofter the other. 
Finally, the testimonials sections. This section features 3 testimonials from high profile individuals who have used the service before. Each testimonial includes a rounded image of the person to give it a more modern and sleek look, followed by the name and title of the person in bold text so it stands out and gives emphasis on who they are and what they do but also to contrast with the paragraph below which is their testimonial for Xclusive Suits. The testiominal is a paragraph with its text aligned ceterally for an organised and professional look as both the rounded image and name titles are centered inside thier columns.
On bigger screens starting from a width of 691px the testiominals are divided equalliy in the same column each taking a third of the screen howver on screens with a width smaller than 691px each testiomials features in its own full with colum so they each appear one after the other rather than side by side.
